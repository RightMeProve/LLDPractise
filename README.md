# LLD Practice: Design Patterns 🚀

This repository is a comprehensive log of my progress through **Low-Level Design (LLD)**. Each directory contains a specific pattern implemented using the principles found in *Head First Design Patterns*.

## 📌 Progress Tracker
I use this table to track which patterns have been successfully implemented and reviewed.

| Status | # | Pattern | Implementation Project | Type |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ✅ | 1 | **Strategy** | Duck Simulator | Behavioral |
| ✅ | 2 | **Observer** | Weather-O-Rama | Behavioral |
| ✅ | 3 | **Decorator** | Starbuzz Coffee | Structural |
| ✅ | 4 | **Simple Factory** | PizzaStore (Idiom) | Creational |
| ✅ | 5 | **Factory Method** | PizzaStore (Regional) | Creational |
| ✅ | 6 | **Abstract Factory** | PizzaStore (Ingredients) | Creational |
| ✅ | 7 | **Singleton** | Singleton Variations | Creational |

## 🏗 Repository Philosophy
The goal of this project is to practice **SOLID** principles through hands-on coding:

* **Encapsulate what varies:** Separating behavior and creation from core logic.
* **Open/Closed Principle:** Designing classes so they are open for extension (adding new products/behaviors) but closed for modification.
* **Dependency Inversion:** Depending on abstractions (Interfaces/Abstract classes) rather than concrete implementations.

## 📂 Project Structure
Each folder is a self-contained module. To explore a pattern, navigate to its directory to see the class structure and test drives.
